## Overview

CanAirIO Bike try to motivate collaboration from cyclists or people that use it to have mobile tracks of air quality. We have two new device versions, CanAirIO bike with PM2.5 sensors (Sensirion SPS30) and CanAirIO CO2 (Sensirion SCD30), the latter for sensing the right ventilation in indoors to reduce COVID-19 risk.

## Features

These devices able to work in standalone mode without clouds, apps, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc. but also you could have the next features:

- Citizen Science community
- CanAirIO is Open-Source / Open-Design / Open-Access
- Two modes: mobile (Bluetooth) or fixed station (WiFi)
- AQI graph with colors for PM and CO2 values
- Standard Bluetooth low energy device (GATT)
- Automatic remote firmware updates
- Two action buttons with some shortcuts
- Good quiescent current ~173uA
- USB Type C interface (support charging on power off)

### Mobile station features

- GPS data tagging via CanAirIO app using Bluetooth Low Energy
- Two device faces: Air quality or Bike mode screens for now.
- Some built-in functions: Brightness, AQI graph, sample time, Wifi On/Off, calibration, etc.

### Fixed station features

- CanAirIO cloud alternative : Basic remote dashboard and database
- Custom InfluxDb alternative: Store all data in your own instance
- MQTT clouds (coming soon)
- Sensor Community and other open clouds (coming soon)
